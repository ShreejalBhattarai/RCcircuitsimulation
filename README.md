# RC Circuit Simulation Project

This project models, simulates, and analyzes the transient response of a first-order RC (Resistor-Capacitor) circuit.

## Project Overview
The focus is on solving the differential equation for the voltage across a capacitor after it begins discharging through a resistor. The project covers:

- Derivation of the differential equation.
- Analytical solution of the circuit behavior for \( t > 0 \).
- Python simulation to visualize the capacitor voltage over time.
- LTspice simulation to validate the theoretical model.
- Comparison between Python and LTspice results.


## Circuit Details
- Initial capacitor voltage: **50V**
- Resistance: **10kΩ**
- Capacitance: **400μF**

At \( t=0 \), the charged capacitor discharges through the resistor, and the voltage decays exponentially.
